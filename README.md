#Intro to Elixir

This is the tutorial app from the elixir-lang website. http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html

In the tutorial I will build a key-value store and use the three
following tools.

- OTP (Open Telecom Platform) - a set of libraries that ships with Erlang. Erlang developers use OTP to build robust, fault-tolerant applications. In this chapter we will explore how many aspects from OTP integrate with Elixir, including supervision trees, event managers and more;

- Mix - a build tool that ships with Elixir that provides tasks for creating, compiling, testing your application, managing its dependencies and much more;

- ExUnit - a test-unit based framework that ships with Elixir;
