#Intro to Elixir

This is the tutorial app from the elixir-lang website. http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html

In the tutorial I will build a key-value store and use the three
following tools.

- OTP (Open Telecom Platform) - a set of libraries that ships with Erlang. Erlang developers use OTP to build robust, fault-tolerant applications. In this chapter we will explore how many aspects from OTP integrate with Elixir, including supervision trees, event managers and more.

- Mix - a build tool that ships with Elixir that provides tasks for creating, compiling, testing your application, managing its dependencies and much more. Mix appears to be very similar to Ruby's Rake. Which makes sense I guess since Rake kinda goes with the whole zen garden motiff I see with a lot of Ruby related stuff and you would Mix an Elixir.

- ExUnit - a test-unit based framework that ships with Elixir.
